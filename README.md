## Important Insights
 1) **Service Level is On Target**
    - At 92.0%, we‚Äôre meeting our goal (91.5%), showing good responsiveness, but we need to keep monitoring performance on certain days.
 3) **Hold Time** 
    - Current hold rate is 10.8%, exceeding the 10% target. Process optimization may help reduce this
 3) **First Call Resolution (FCR)**
    - We achieved 92.1% FCR, which is well above the target (80%). This means most customer issues are solved on the first call a strong sign of quality service.
4) **Answer Rate Needs Improvement**
    - Current rate is 93.2%, slightly below the 95% target. This means we need to improve staffing or efficiency during busy hours.
 5) **Peak Hour is 3‚Äì4 PM**
    - The highest call volume occurs between 3:00 and 4:00 PM with over 2,450 calls. This is a key time to ensure strong agent coverage.
 6) **Sunday & Saturday weekends volume & performance**
    - Saturday and Sunday show 100% service level, mainly due to very low call volume and sufficient staffing.
 7) **Customer Inquiries & Resolution Rate**
    - The resolution rate is highest for Tech Support (80.2%) and slightly lower for Billing and Complaints (78‚Äì79%).
 8) **Some agents rated below target**
    - A few agents didn‚Äôt meet the target in several KPIs like rating, AHT, and hold %. This shows they may need more training or support to improve their performance.
