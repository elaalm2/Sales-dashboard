## üóÇÔ∏è Case Study
A mid-sized retail company was experiencing stagnant sales growth and needed visibility into their performance across different products, regions, and customer behaviors. Stakeholders lacked a consolidated view of critical KPIs and trends over time.

## üéØ Objective
Build an interactive dashboard that helps business decision-makers:
> - Track overall sales performance and profitability
> - Identify underperforming and overperforming categories and regions
> - Understand the impact of different payment methods on revenue
> - Compare metrics against the previous year using Time Intelligence

## Main ùêäùêèùêàùê¨
- **<ins>Total Sales</ins>**: It is the sum of all Sales amounts for orders sold.
- **<ins>Total profit</ins>**: It is the sum of all Profit gained for orders sold.
- **<ins>Total Orders</ins>**: It is the total number of orders placed. 
- **<ins>AVG Order Value</ins>**: It is the average amount paid by a customer to place a single order.
- **<ins>Profit Margin %</ins>**: It is the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses are deducted.

## Process
